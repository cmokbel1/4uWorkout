- 4uWorkout lets users select specific body parts to work out and then produces a workout in relation to their selection.
- users can also select a genre of music and have a playlist be built. 
- users can save workouts onto the local storage to keep a record of the workouts they have completed.


-Primary concerns were making the buttons work in the manner we wanted them to. Randomized workout button effectively randomizes a workout from the array that is provided by the exercise API. Next Song and Previous Song buttons also provided some issues for us.
-The largest hurdle we encountered was randomizing a workout for the user in relation to the body part that is being chosen. Prior to the API spitting out a workout, we had to filter out each body part into a seperate array of like workouts. Once the user selected which body part they want to workout, the function filters through the input and its corresponding body part array. 

We used Iconify, and bootstrap to complete with project while also pulling palattes from the coolors.co website to style the pages.
